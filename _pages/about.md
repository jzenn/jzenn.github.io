I am Johannes Zenn, a machine learning student at the University of Tübingen, Germany. 

I finished my undergraduate studies in computer science at the University of Tübingen. My studies focussed on deep learning, computer vision and algorithms. 

## Experience

Since 2018 I am a working student at [Schwarz IT](https://www.it.schwarz/) where I have been involved in the development and training of a chatbot system. Currently, my tasks include data clustering and data mining.
