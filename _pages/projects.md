## [DAIS0](/projects/dais0)
The code for our work [Differentiable Annealed Importance Sampling Minimizes The Jensen-Shannon Divergence Between Initial and Target Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14840). We investigate the initial distribution of differentiable annealed importance sampling and find that it minimizes the Jensen-Shannon divergence between its initial distribution and target distribution.
Motivated by this insight we use the initial distribution for variational inference.

## [SVHN-Remix](/svhn-remix)
We find that the SVHN dataset ([Netzer et al., 2011](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/nips2011_housenumbers.pdf)) suffers from a [distribution shift between training set and test set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02168). 
We analyze the distribution shift and its implications and provide a new split

## [DSMCS](/projects/dsmcs)
The code for our work [Resampling Gradients Vanish in Differentiable Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14390) where we propose a differentiable Sequential Monte Carlo Sampler and show that there is no need for differentiating the resampling operation if the effective sample size is maximal.

## [Minima-Slides](/projects/minima-slides)
Modern and simplistic LaTeX beamer slides for professional and private use.
