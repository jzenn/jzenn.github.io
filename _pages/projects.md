Below, you can find some projects I have been working on.

## [Image Autoencoder](/projects/image-autoencoder)

This project implements an autoencoder network that encodes an image to its feature 
representation. The feature representation of an image can be used to conduct style 
transfer between a content image and a style image.

## [Moment Alignment](/projects/moment-alignment)
This project implements an extension to the Adaptive Instance Normalization module 
from the approach that was proposed by Huang et al. in **(cite Huang et al.)**.
The moment alignment module is able to not only adapt the first two statistical 
moments of content feature maps and style feature maps but also to align up to 
five statistical moments.

## [Neural Transfer](/projects/neural-transfer)
This project implements an extension to the Adaptive Instance Normalization approach 
that was proposed by Huang et al. in **(cite Huang et al.)**.

## [Style Visualizations](/projects/style-visualizations)
This project implements the a style visualization algorithm proposed by Mahendran
et al. in **(cite Mahendran et al.)**. Gradient descent is performed on a noise image to
match the (style) features of a style image produced by an encoder network. 

## [AdaINExt](/projects/ada-in-ext)
This project implements the neural transfer algorithm proposed by Gatys
et al. in **(cite Gatys et al.)**. Gradient descent is performed on a noise image to
match the features of a content image and a style image produced by an encoder network.
