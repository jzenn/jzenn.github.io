Below, you can find some projects I have been working on.


## [Cluster](/projects/cluster)
A clustering package for k-Means Clustering and Spectral Clustering

## [ML Utils](/projects/ml-utils)
This repository is (yet another) helper library for machine learning and deep learning. 
It is very specific and simple to use and might be helpful for my use-case only.

## [Minima-Slides](/projects/minima-slides)
This projects wants to provide modern and simplistic LaTeX Beamer slides for professional and private use.

## [Bachlor's Thesis](/projects/bsc-thesis)

You can find my Bachelor's Thesis on the topic *Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation with 
Induced Feature Statistics* here.

## [Image Autoencoder](/projects/image-autoencoder)

This project implements an autoencoder network that encodes an image to its feature 
representation. The feature representation of an image can be used to conduct style 
transfer between a content image and a style image.

## [Style Visualizations](/projects/style-visualizations)
This project implements a style visualization algorithm proposed by Mahendran et al. 
Gradient descent is performed on a noise image to
match the (style) features of a style image produced by an encoder network. 

## [Moment Alignment](/projects/moment-alignment)
This project implements an extension to the Adaptive Instance Normalization module from the approach that was proposed by Huang et al. The moment alignment module is able to not only adapt the first two statistical moments of content feature maps and style feature maps but also to align up to five statistical moments.

## [Neural Transfer](/projects/neural-transfer)
This project implements the neural transfer algorithm proposed by Gatys et al. Gradient descent is performed on a noise image to match the features of a content image and a style image produced by an encoder network.

## [AdaINExt](/projects/ada-in-ext)
This project implements an extension to the Adaptive Instance Normalization approach that was proposed by Huang et al.
