## [SVHN-Remix](/svhn-remix)
We find that the SVHN dataset ([Netzer et al., 2011](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/nips2011_housenumbers.pdf)) suffers from a [distribution shift between training set and test set](.). 
We analyze the distribution shift and the implications and provide a new split

## [DSMCS](/projects/dsmcs)
The code for our work [Resampling Gradients Vanish in Differentiable Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14390) where we propose a differentiable Sequential Monte Carlo Sampler and show that there is no need for differentiating the resampling operation if the effective sample size is maximal.

## [Minima-Slides](/projects/minima-slides)
Modern and simplistic LaTeX beamer slides for professional and private use.
