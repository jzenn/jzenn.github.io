Below, you can find some projects I have been working on.
*Please note that some of these projects are not yet publically available.*

## [Image Autoencoder](/projects/image-autoencoder)

This project implements an autoencoder network that encodes an image to its feature 
representation. The feature representation of an image can be used to conduct style 
transfer between a content image and a style image.

## [Style Visualizations](/projects/style-visualizations)
This project implements a style visualization algorithm proposed by Mahendran et al. 
Gradient descent is performed on a noise image to
match the (style) features of a style image produced by an encoder network. 

## [ML Utils](/projects/ml-utils)
This repository is (yet another) helper library for machine learning and deep learning. 
It is very specific and simple to use and might be helpful for my use-case only.

## [Documentation](/projects/documentation/)
I started to do some documentation on several python libraries consisting of commands 
that I felt needing to document. Note that this might be a very specific and personal
list of commands.

## [Moment Alignment](/projects/moment-alignment)
*I will provide some more information on this project soon.*

## [Neural Transfer](/projects/neural-transfer)
*I will provide some more information on this project soon.*

## [AdaINExt](/projects/ada-in-ext)
*I will provide some more information on this project soon.*
