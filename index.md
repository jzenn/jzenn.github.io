I am a PhD student at [University of TÃ¼bingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en) and the [International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems](https://imprs.is.mpg.de) supervised by [Robert Bamler](https://robamler.github.io). 
My PhD is funded by the [Cluster of Excellence Machine Learning](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/).
I am interested in deep (probabilistic) models, flexible and efficient inference methods, and data compression.

Recently, I have been working with Differentiable Annealed Importance Sampling (DAIS). Our latest [ICML 2024 paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rvaN2P1rvC) shows that DAIS minimizes the Jensen-Shannon divergence between initial and target distribution and investigates a useful inference method utilizing the learned initial distribution.
In our [ICLR 2023 Tiny Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14390) we equip DAIS with a resampling step and explain how a maximal Effective Sample Size influences gradients due to resampling (spoiler: you do not need them).

Our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02168) at the [NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Distribution Shifts](https://sites.google.com/view/distshift2023) finds that the SVHN dataset suffers from a distribution mismatch between the training set and test set that impacts probabilistic generative models. A new canonical split can be downloaded from the [project page](/svhn-remix).
