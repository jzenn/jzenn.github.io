I am a PhD student at [University of TÃ¼bingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en) and the [International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems](https://imprs.is.mpg.de) supervised by [Robert Bamler](https://robamler.github.io). 
My PhD is funded by the [Cluster of Excellence Machine Learning](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/).
I am interested in deep (probabilistic) models, flexible and efficient inference methods for large (language) models, and data compression.
