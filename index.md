I am a PhD student at [University of TÃ¼bingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en) and the [International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems](https://imprs.is.mpg.de) supervised by [Robert Bamler](https://robamler.github.io). 
I am interested in flexible and efficient inference methods for deep probabilistic models.
Additionally, I am interested in applications of probabilistic machine learning in science.
My PhD is funded by the [Cluster of Excellence Machine Learning](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/).

Most recently, we found that the SVHN dataset suffers from a distribution mismatch between the training set and test set that impacts probabilistic generative models. We will present the corresponding [paper](.) at the [NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Distribution Shifts](https://sites.google.com/view/distshift2023). A new canonical split can be downloaded from the [project page](/svhn-remix).

Lately, I have been investigating connections between (Differentiable) Annealed Importance Sampling and (Differentiable) Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling methods. 
Our latest paper [Resampling Gradients Vanish in Differentiable Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14390) explains how a maximal Effective Sample Size influences gradients due to resampling (spoiler: you do not need them).
A poster that we presented at ICLR 2023 can be found [here](https://nc.mlcloud.uni-tuebingen.de/index.php/s/pcsRa74ArmXirz4).
