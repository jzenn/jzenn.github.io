I am a PhD student at [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en) and [International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems](https://imprs.is.mpg.de) supervised by [Robert Bamler](https://robamler.github.io). 
I am interested in flexible and efficient inference methods for deep probabilistic models and applications of probabilistic machine learning in science.
My PhD is funded by the [Cluster of Excellence Machine Learning](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/).

Currently, I am investigating connections between (Differentiable) Annealed Importance Sampling and (Differentiable) Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling Methods. 
My latest work [Resampling Gradients Vanish in Differentiable Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers](https://openreview.net/forum?id=kBkou5ucR_d) (TinyPaper at ICLR 2023) explains how a maximal Effective Sample Size influences gradients due to resampling (spoiler: you do not need them).

Last year, I finished my [Master's thesis](https://nc.mlcloud.uni-tuebingen.de/index.php/s/zmMGsi3jMP68pkc) on the topic *Machine Learning for Thermodynamics: Equipping Data Driven Prediction Methods with Chemical Prior Knowledge*.
The work proposes hybrid models for the field of physical chemistry and thermodynamics that integrate chemical knowledge into a data-driven probabilistic machine learning model.
A poster that I presented at the [Nordic Probabilistic AI School](https://probabilistic.ai) can be found [here](https://nc.mlcloud.uni-tuebingen.de/index.php/s/6twDbp6Kdtazctn).

I was in the first year of students of the [Machine Learning Master's](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/study/finding-a-course/degree-programs-available/detail/course/machine-learning-master/) program at the University of Tübingen. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the University of Tübingen in 2019.
