**This site is under construction.**

This personal website aims at giving you a brief introduction to myself as well as presenting some of the projects I have been working on.

I am Johannes Zenn, a machine learning student at the University of Tübingen, Germany. 

I finished my undergraduate studies in computer science at the University of Tübingen. My studies focussed on deep learning, computer vision and algorithms. 

Some work I did in my Bachelor's thesis *Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation with Induced Feature Statistics* can be explored in the [Projects](/projects) section.

Since 2018 I am a working student at [Schwarz IT](https://www.it.schwarz/) where I am involved in the development, training, testing and data mining of a chatbot system.
