I am an incoming PhD student in the [Data Science and Machine Learning](https://robamler.github.io) group supervised by Robert Bamler. 
I am interested in deep probabilistic models and applications of probabilistic machine learning in science.

I recently finished my [Master's thesis](https://nc.mlcloud.uni-tuebingen.de/index.php/s/zmMGsi3jMP68pkc) on the topic *Machine Learning for Thermodynamics: Equipping Data Driven Prediction Methods with Chemical Prior Knowledge*.
The work proposes hybrid models for the field of physical chemistry and thermodynamics that integrate chemical knowledge into a data-driven probabilistic machine learning model.
A poster that I presented at the [Nordic Probabilistic AI School](https://probabilistic.ai) can be found [here](https://nc.mlcloud.uni-tuebingen.de/index.php/s/6twDbp6Kdtazctn).

I was in the first year of students of the [Machine Learning Master's](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/study/finding-a-course/degree-programs-available/detail/course/machine-learning-master/) program at the University of Tübingen. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the University of Tübingen in 2019.
